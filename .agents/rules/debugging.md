When debugging, follow these systematic principles: specialized in systematic bug hunting and root cause analysis. Apply rigorous reasoning to identify, isolate, and fix bugs efficiently.

## Core Debugging Principles

Before investigating any bug, you must methodically plan and reason about:

### 1) Problem Understanding & Reproduction
1.1) Gather complete symptom information: What exactly is happening vs. what should happen?
1.2) Identify reproduction steps: Can the bug be consistently reproduced?
1.3) Determine scope: Is this isolated or affecting multiple areas?
1.4) Check environment: Development, staging, or production? What versions?

### 2) Hypothesis Generation (Abductive Reasoning)
2.1) Generate multiple hypotheses ranked by likelihood:
- Most likely: Recent code changes in the affected area
- Common: Data/state issues, race conditions, edge cases
- Less likely: Infrastructure, third-party dependencies, compiler bugs
2.2) Don't assume the obvious cause - the bug might be elsewhere
2.3) Consider interaction effects between components
2.4) Check for similar past bugs or known issues

### 3) Systematic Investigation
3.1) Binary search approach: Narrow down the problem space by half each step
3.2) Add strategic logging/breakpoints at key decision points
3.3) Trace data flow from input to output
3.4) Check all assumptions explicitly - verify, don't assume
3.5) Examine stack traces, error messages, and logs thoroughly

### 4) Evidence Collection
4.1) Document what you've tried and observed
4.2) Capture relevant code snippets, logs, and error messages
4.3) Note any patterns or correlations
4.4) Track which hypotheses have been ruled out and why

### 5) Root Cause Identification
5.1) Distinguish between root cause and symptoms
5.2) Ask "why" five times to drill down to the actual cause
5.3) Verify the root cause explains ALL observed symptoms
5.4) Consider if there could be multiple contributing factors

### 6) Fix Implementation
6.1) Design the minimal fix that addresses the root cause
6.2) Consider potential side effects of the fix
6.3) Add tests to prevent regression
6.4) Document the fix and why it works

### 7) Verification
7.1) Confirm the bug is fixed with the original reproduction steps
7.2) Test edge cases and related functionality
7.3) Verify no new issues were introduced
7.4) If the fix doesn't work, return to hypothesis generation

### 8) Persistence Rules
8.1) Don't give up after one or two failed hypotheses
8.2) If stuck, take a step back and reconsider assumptions
8.3) Consider asking for more information or context
8.4) Document progress even if the bug isn't fully solved

## Debugging Checklist
- [ ] Can I reproduce the bug?
- [ ] Have I identified when it started (which commit/change)?
- [ ] Have I checked logs and error messages?
- [ ] Have I verified my assumptions?
- [ ] Have I considered edge cases?
- [ ] Does my fix address the root cause, not just symptoms?
- [ ] Have I added tests to prevent regression?
