When performing a security audit or reviewing code for vulnerabilities**, apply systematic reasoning following OWASP guidelines and security best practices:

## Security Audit Principles

Before reviewing any code for security, you must methodically analyze:

### 1) Attack Surface Analysis
1.1) Identify all entry points (APIs, forms, file uploads, webhooks)
1.2) Map data flows from input to storage to output
1.3) Identify trust boundaries
1.4) List all external dependencies and their versions
1.5) Identify privileged operations

### 2) OWASP Top 10 Review

2.1) **Injection** (SQL, NoSQL, Command, LDAP)
- Are all queries parameterized?
- Is user input ever concatenated into queries?
- Are ORM queries safe from injection?
- Is shell command execution avoided with user input?

2.2) **Broken Authentication**
- Are passwords hashed with strong algorithms (bcrypt, Argon2)?
- Is MFA available for sensitive operations?
- Are session tokens secure (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite)?
- Is there account lockout after failed attempts?

2.3) **Sensitive Data Exposure**
- Is sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit?
- Are API keys, secrets in environment variables (not code)?
- Is PII properly protected?
- Are error messages generic (no stack traces in production)?

2.4) **XML External Entities (XXE)**
- Is XML parsing configured to disable external entities?
- Are safer data formats (JSON) used when possible?

2.5) **Broken Access Control**
- Are all endpoints properly authorized?
- Is there IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference) protection?
- Are CORS policies properly configured?
- Is principle of least privilege followed?

2.6) **Security Misconfiguration**
- Are default credentials changed?
- Are unnecessary features disabled?
- Are security headers set (CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.)?
- Is HTTPS enforced?

2.7) **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
- Is all user input escaped before rendering?
- Is Content Security Policy in place?
- Are dangerous functions (innerHTML, eval) avoided?
- Is input validated on both client and server?

2.8) **Insecure Deserialization**
- Is untrusted data ever deserialized?
- Are safe alternatives used (JSON instead of pickle)?

2.9) **Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities**
- Are dependencies up to date?
- Is there a process for security updates?
- Are vulnerability scanners in CI/CD?

2.10) **Insufficient Logging & Monitoring**
- Are security events logged?
- Are logs protected from tampering?
- Is there alerting for suspicious activity?

### 3) Risk Assessment
For each vulnerability found:
3.1) Severity: Critical / High / Medium / Low
3.2) Likelihood: How easy is it to exploit?
3.3) Impact: What's the damage if exploited?
3.4) Priority: Severity × Likelihood

### 4) Remediation Recommendations
4.1) Provide specific fix recommendations
4.2) Include code examples when possible
4.3) Reference security standards (OWASP, CWE)
4.4) Suggest defense-in-depth approaches
4.5) Prioritize fixes by risk level

### 5) Security Headers Checklist
- [ ] Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)
- [ ] Content-Security-Policy
- [ ] X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- [ ] X-Frame-Options: DENY
- [ ] X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- [ ] Referrer-Policy
- [ ] Permissions-Policy
