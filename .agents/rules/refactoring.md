When refactoring code**, apply systematic reasoning to safely improve code quality without changing behavior:

## Refactoring Principles

Before performing any refactoring, you must methodically plan and reason about:

### 1) Understanding Before Changing
1.1) What does this code do? (Document understanding first)
1.2) Why was it written this way? (There may be good reasons)
1.3) What are the inputs, outputs, and side effects?
1.4) What tests exist? (Do NOT refactor without tests)
1.5) Who depends on this code?

### 2) Identifying Refactoring Opportunities

**Code Smells to Look For:**

2.1) **Long Methods/Functions**
- Methods > 20 lines
- Multiple levels of nesting
- Solution: Extract smaller functions

2.2) **Large Classes**
- Classes doing too much (violating SRP)
- Too many instance variables
- Solution: Split into smaller, focused classes

2.3) **Duplicate Code**
- Same logic in multiple places
- Copy-paste with minor variations
- Solution: Extract common code

2.4) **Long Parameter Lists**
- > 3-4 parameters
- Related parameters that travel together
- Solution: Introduce parameter objects

2.5) **Feature Envy**
- Method using more from another class
- Solution: Move method to the right class

2.6) **Primitive Obsession**
- Using strings/numbers for domain concepts
- Solution: Create domain objects

2.7) **Nested Conditionals**
- Deep if/else nesting
- Solution: Guard clauses, polymorphism

2.8) **Dead Code**
- Unused variables, functions, imports
- Solution: Remove it

### 3) Safe Refactoring Process

3.1) **Ensure Test Coverage**
- Write tests BEFORE refactoring if none exist
- Tests must pass before AND after
- Tests are your safety net

3.2) **Small, Incremental Steps**
- One change at a time
- Run tests after each step
- Commit after each successful step
- Easy to bisect and revert if needed

3.3) **Rename for Clarity**
- Use intention-revealing names
- Update all references
- Update documentation

3.4) **Extract Method**
- Identify cohesive code blocks
- Name describes WHAT, not HOW
- Keep parameters minimal

3.5) **Simplify Conditionals**
- Use guard clauses for early returns
- Extract complex conditions into named booleans
- Consider polymorphism for type-switching

### 4) Common Refactoring Patterns

4.1) **Extract Function**: Pull out code into named function
4.2) **Inline Function**: Remove unnecessary indirection
4.3) **Extract Variable**: Name complex expressions
4.4) **Rename**: Improve naming clarity
4.5) **Move Function**: Put code where it belongs
4.6) **Replace Conditional with Polymorphism**
4.7) **Introduce Parameter Object**
4.8) **Replace Magic Number with Constant**
4.9) **Decompose Conditional**
4.10) **Consolidate Duplicate Conditional Fragments**

### 5) Risk Mitigation
5.1) Never refactor and add features in the same commit
5.2) Keep refactoring PRs small and focused
5.3) Document why the refactoring was done
5.4) Consider performance implications
5.5) Watch for behavior changes (especially with dates, floats)

### 6) When NOT to Refactor
6.1) No tests and no time to add them
6.2) Deadline pressure (you'll introduce bugs)
6.3) Code is about to be replaced anyway
6.4) You don't understand what the code does
6.5) The code works and no one needs to change it

## Refactoring Checklist
- [ ] Do I understand what this code does?
- [ ] Are there tests covering this code?
- [ ] Are all tests passing before I start?
- [ ] Am I making one small change at a time?
- [ ] Are tests still passing after each change?
- [ ] Did I update documentation if needed?
- [ ] Is the code clearer/simpler than before?
- [ ] Did I NOT change the behavior?
